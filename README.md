# MIT-Designing-and-Building-AI-Products-and-Services

This repository contains my learning notes from MIT course on Designing and Building AI Products and Services. These
notes are self prepared to learn the course better and it is solely my work.

# Module 1

## Learn the basics of AI, ML, NLP and Deep learning:

[1] Machine learning:

- Teach machines to identify the patterns from the trained data.
- Allow computer to find the pattern so it can learn.
- 3 types of learning:
    - Supervised Learning
    - Unsupervised
    - Semi-Supervised.

[2] NLP:

- Allow computer to interact in human languages
- Ex: Language translation service; Chatbots.

[3] Deep Learning:

- Mimics the structure of Brain & function of Brain.
- Like brain has network of neurons to learn, reasoning ect. Deep learning has neural networks
- It has multiple layers of data processing between input and output.
- This allows to identify the very complex PATTERNS from the data like text, images, sound or combination of all.
- Ex: Computer vision - Face recognition; Self-driving cars ect.

## Introduction to AI Design Process:

### 4 stages of AI design process:

[1] Intelligence
[2] Business process
[3] AI Technology
[4] Tinkering

#### [1] first stage of the AI design process: Identifying the desired behavior of the AI product.

- Most important criteria of decisions is:
    - performance metrics : Error rate of image recognition.
    - scope : self-driving car. what all objects need to be recognized.

- Natural Language processing:
    - Sentiment Analysis
    - Summarize document
    - Summarize news
    - Answer questions
    - Maintain dialog
    - Analyze Reviews like google reviews

    - Sentiment analysis progress includes:
        - Coreference resolution. Ex: Identifying the expressions referring to text.
        - Word sense disambiguation
        - Parsing

#### [2] Business process:

- Two main areas where AI can help Business processes:
    - Strategic
    - Operational

[2.1] Strategic:

- Product Layer : Use the best AI product like build best fingerprint sensor.
- Customer Solution: Use AI product for best computer vision to incorporate in Self-driving car.
- Network Externalities : Build a large database of users so others can be more useful. Like more fingerprints in DB
  allows us to identify the people.

[2.2] Operational:

- Business process: Focus on operational process description like reduce the legal translation cost by using AI model in
  the legal translation service.
- Sensible Improvement targets: More measurable points like reduces the cost of translation by 80%.
