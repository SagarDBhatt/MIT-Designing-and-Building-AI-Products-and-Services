# MIT-Designing-and-Building-AI-Products-and-Services

This repository contains my learning notes from MIT course on Designing and Building AI Products and Services. These
notes are self prepared to learn the course better and it is solely my work.

## Module 1

#### Learn the basics of AI, ML, NLP and Deep learning:

[1] Machine learning:

- Teach machines to identify the patterns from the trained data.
- Allow computer to find the pattern so it can learn.
- 3 types of learning:
    - Supervised Learning
    - Unsupervised
    - Semi-Supervised.

[2] NLP:

- Allow computer to interact in human languages
- Ex: Language translation service; Chatbots.

[3] Deep Learning:

- Mimics the structure of Brain & function of Brain.
- Like brain has network of neurons to learn, reasoning ect. Deep learning has neural networks
- It has multiple layers of data processing between input and output.
- This allows to identify the very complex PATTERNS from the data like text, images, sound or combination of all.
- Ex: Computer vision - Face recognition; Self-driving cars ect.
